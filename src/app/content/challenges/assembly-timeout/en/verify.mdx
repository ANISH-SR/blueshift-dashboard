<ChallengeTitle>sBPF Assembly Timeout</ChallengeTitle>

Create a program only has one instruction. It must:
- Take in no accounts.
- Take in a u64 (8-byte) slot in instruction data.
- Call `sol_get_clock_sysvar` syscall to get the current `Clock` data.
- Check if the current slot is greater than the slot passed in the instruction. If it is, return error code 1.

Start by installing the sBPF package like explained in the [tooling section](en/courses/introduction-to-assembly/tooling) of the Introduction to Assembly course and build your program using the following command in your terminal:

```
sbpf light-build
```

This will generate a `.so` file in your `target/deploy` folder. 

Now click on the `take challenge` button and drop the file there!
