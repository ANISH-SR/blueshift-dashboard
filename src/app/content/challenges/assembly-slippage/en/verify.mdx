<ChallengeTitle>sBPF Assembly Slippage</ChallengeTitle>

Create a program only has one instruction. It must:
- Take in a single SPL or Token2022 Token account
- Take in a u64 (8-byte) minimum balance in instruction data
- Dynamically calculate the offset to the minimum balance
- If slippage is exceeded, log the string `Slippage exceeded` and return error code 1

Start by installing the sBPF package like explained in the [tooling section](en/courses/introduction-to-assembly/tooling) of the Introduction to Assembly course and build your program using the following command in your terminal:

```
sbpf light-build
```

This will generate a `.so` file in your `target/deploy` folder. 

Now click on the `take challenge` button and drop the file there!
